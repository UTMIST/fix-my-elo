- create agent class
    set up NN architecture, train and store weights
        ! Supervised learning policy network (keishi)
        ! RL policy network (jacqueline)
        ! value network (kushagra)
    ! implement MCTS (vincent)

- implement environment class (doesnt have to be gymnasium; but it has to bridge Python chess and the agent)
    loop to for human to play the game against the agent
    methods to terminate the game
    print the current state
    print which pieces have been taken

- A script that will initialize the agent and print the board at each turn


Timeline:

saturday nov 1 (morning): finish implementing architecture
saturday nov 1 (evening): finish training NN
wednesday nov 5: all remaining classes implemented
friday nov 7: script ready
Present saturday nov 8!


Next Steps:
- combine NN layers into class, test and train
   - save weights and write script to load them
- Create Agent class with MCTS imlpemented
- Create environment class
- Create simple script to create and activate a virtual env
- Create script to actually play chess against the agent


(maybe) some way of evaluating how good/bad our current solution is?
