# create agent class
    # set up NN architecture, train and store weights
        # Supervised learning policy network
        # RL policy network
        # value network
    # implement MCTS

# implement environment (doesnt have to be gymnasium; but it has to bridge Python chess and the agent)
    # loop to for human to play the game against the agent
    # methods to terminate the game
    # print the current state
    # print which pieces have been taken

# (if we have time): A script that will initialize the agent and print the board at each turn

# (maybe) some way of evaluating how good/bad our current solution is?
