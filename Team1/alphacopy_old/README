This is a copy of the stuff in the og repo (made by me aka colleen)
I didn't want to mess with the files we already have lmao so I'm isolating my work in here

# Main Features 
- Self-play training loop
- Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) implementation
- Neural network model training
- Game state evaluation and policy generation

# TODO
- trouble shoot self play since I believe it runs too slowly to make reasonable progress
